# Super Store Management System

Upon observing our surroundings, we noticed that many local and yet-growing superstore owners are still working manually, using registers and journals to maintain their routine data. The owners of non well known superstore (which are many in number) are either unaware of the database management system or choose not to implement that into their businesses for one of the reasons to be complex to use.

So, we decided to develop a project, especially for these superstore owners based on the POS (point of sale) concept to try to make their work life less hectic.

## Installation
To run this project firstly on your PC there must be a WinRAR to unzip the given zipped folder of the super store management system. The link is given below:

```bash
https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0
```
Also, You need to open or run this project on Netbeans. If you have no need to Install it but if not then install it using the given link below to use Netbeans you need to install JDK which can also be downloaded from the same link.

```bash

```

Moreover, we used JCalendar in our project so you also need to download it and import it into the libraries in the project. The link is given below:

```bash

```
And you need to install the java connection provider jar file and import it into the libraries. To Download it the link is given below:

```bash
https://jar-download.com/artifacts/mysql/mysql-connector-java
```

In the end, you need to design the schema because we use the database in it so, therefore, the SQL schema file that we have given you. You need to run that file to create a database.
