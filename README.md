# Super-Store-Management-System
This project is totally based on Java and using MySQL database for storing the data permanently. This project is basically designed for those restaurants who are still working manually. So, I decided to come up with a project specially for these super stores owners based on POS (point of sale) concept to try making their work life less hectic.
